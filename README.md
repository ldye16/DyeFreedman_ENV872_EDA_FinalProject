# DyeFreedman_ENV872_EDA_FinalProject


## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>

This repository was created to facilitate data storage and analysis for a research project analyzing the effects of climate change on the American pika at Niwot Ridge, CO. The goal was to understand Pika distribution changes over the past 10-15 years and examine the connection to a changing alpine climate. The prevalence of pests (mites and fleas) found on pikas was also assessed over time, as an increase in disease is a widely accepted consequence of climate change. 

The repository contains raw and processed data files, metadata, information on the data sources, and code used for analysis and visualization. 



## Investigators

## Keywords

<add relevant keywords here>

Pika, climate change, temperature, alpine tundra, disease, spatial analysis, population analysis

## Database Information

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

Both climate and pika data was sourced from the Niwot Ridge LTER website on November 27th, 2022. All datasets are for public use and are available here: https://nwt.lternet.edu/data-catalog Significant wrangling was required to answer the research questions.
