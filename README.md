Topic: We are examining Pika demography and climate data from the Niwot Ridge LTER site. Our goal is to understand Pika distribution changes over the past 10-15 years and examine whether there is any connection to the changing alpine climate. We also will investigate the prevalence of pests (mites and fleas) over time. Pika rely on alpine tundra, a habitat severely threatened by climate change, so understanding the population changes would be valuable for future species outlook.
